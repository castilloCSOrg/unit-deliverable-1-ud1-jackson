Item Percentage Caculator 
*	PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
*The purpose of my program is to provide a convenient way to easily calcualte the percentage discount on any item that may be purchased.
*Often, I come across deals, like 15% off, and I have no idea what the final cost would be.
*I realized that through computer science, I could address this weakness by having a computer quickly cacluate the total for me. 
/********************************************

*********************************************
*	ALGORITHM:
*	Get the users input for the discount percentage and the items price. 
*Caculate the amount saved based on the discount entered. 
*Caculate then display the final price with the discount.
