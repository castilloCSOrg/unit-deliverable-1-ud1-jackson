//Water In Take Calculator
//*	PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
//*The purpose of my program is to find how much water should be drank based on multiple facotrs.
//*As an athlete water intake is extremely important so knowing how much water should be drank is dire.
//*I realized that through computer science, I could address this weakness by having a computer quickly cacluate how much water I should be drinking. 
//********************************************

//*********************************************
//*	ALGORITHM:
//*	Get the users input for their weight, tempature outside, and activeness. 
//*Caculate the amount of water they should be drinking.

//* I worked alone
